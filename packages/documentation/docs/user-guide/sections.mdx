# Sections

Sections are at the heart of some of `ChordMark` most powerful features, like the automatic repetition of chords across sections of the same type.
You can think of them as subpart of a song such as `Intro`, `Verse`, `Chorus`, `Solo`...

It is highly recommended to systematically use sections.

## Declaring a section

To create a new section, use the `#` character followed by a single word:

<TabbedChordMark src={'#intro\n#verse\n#bridge\n#chorus\n#verse\n#chorus'} />

Note that you can declare multiple times a section of the same family with the exact same section label (eg `#verse`, `#chorus`...); `ChordMark` will automatically number them.

The section label should be a single word composed of only letters, uppercase or lowercase. 
If another character is present, such a space, then the line will be considered as a lyric line and no section will be declared.

<TabbedChordMark src={'Valid labels:\n#custom\n#mySection\n\nInvalid labels:\n#my section\n#1custom\n#custom 2'} />

To end a section, just declare a new one:

<TabbedChordMark src={'#verse\nThis is the verse \n\n#chorus\nThis is the chorus'} />

## Shorthand notation

In order to speed up the writing process, `ChordMark` has a shorthand notation for the most commonly used sections names. 
It is highly encouraged to use it:

<TabbedChordMark src={'#a\n#b\n#c\n#i\n#o\n#p\n#s\n#u\n#v'} />

## Repeating chords

Once you define the chords for a section, they are automatically repeated for the next section declared with the exact same label. 

<TabbedChordMark src={'#v\nBm7.. E7.. A7\nThe first verse\n\n#c\nD7 %\nThe first chorus\n\n#v\nThe second verse\n\n#c\nThe second chorus'} />

Override possible

## Repeating a whole section

use #c

target a specific section #c2

## multiplying a section

use #c x2
