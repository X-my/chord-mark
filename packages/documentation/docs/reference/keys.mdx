# Key declaration

## Key declaration lines

It is possible to declare the key of any part of the song using they `key` keyword:

<TabbedChordMark src={'key C\nC F G C'} />

There are at least two reasons why you might want to do this.

### Reason 1: proper rendering of accidentals

The first reason relates to the rendering of chord accidentals (`#` and `b`). If your source file contains mixed accidental, then declaring a key will allow <CM/> to automatically normalize the accidentals choosing the proper symbol

<TabbedChordMark
	src={
		'#v\nkey C#m\nC#m7 Ab7\n_ What will you do when you get _lonely?\nC#m7.. C. D. E.. E7..\n_ No one _waiting _by your _side _'
	}
/>

Note that if you don't declare a key, <CM/> will try to automatically detect it based of the chords used in the song.
While this should work reasonnably well for simple songs, it will probably fail on more complex cases.
So as a best practice, it is recommended to always explicitly declare a key.

Accidentals are also properly chosen if the song contains multiple keys:

<TabbedChordMark
	src={
		'#v\nkey C#m\nC#m7 Ab7\n_ What will you do when you get _lonely?\nC#m7.. C. D. E.. E7..\n_ No one _waiting _by your _side _\n\n#c\nkey Dm\nDm.. Bb..\nLayla_\nC.. Dm.. Dm.. A#..\n_Got me on my _knees, Layla'
	}
/>

When transposing in the accidental `auto` mode, <CM/> tries to be smart and avoid [theoretical keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_key) that are not used in practice.
For example transposing down `Layla` by 1 semitone will result in a key of `C#m` instead of `Dbm` for the chorus. Again, note that the proper accidentals are used for each key.

<TabbedChordMark
	src={
		'#v\nkey C#m\nC#m7 Ab7\n_ What will you do when you get _lonely?\nC#m7.. C. D. E.. E7..\n_ No one _waiting _by your _side _\n\n#c\nkey Dm\nDm.. Bb..\nLayla_\nC.. Dm.. Dm.. A#..\n_Got me on my _knees, Layla'
	}
	options={{ transposeValue: -1 }}
/>

### Reason 2: harmonic analysis

The second reason is if you want <CM/> to help with harmonic analysis by rendering the chord symbols as [roman numeral symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral_analysis).
This can only be done if a key is explicitly set, otherwise all symbols will be rendered as `I`, `i` or `?`.
The approach to convert chords from notes to numerals symbols is very basic and naive: based on the declared key, <CM/> will just detect if the song's chord are diatonic to the key,
or diatonic to the parallel major/minor key (e.g. "borrowed" chords).
Of course there is much more to harmonic analysis than this simple approach and I hope to enrich <CM/>'s capabilities with more functionality in the future.

<TabbedChordMark
	src={
		'key Em\n6/8\nEm D. C.\n_ Forever trusting _who we are\nG.  B7. Em %\n_ and _nothing else _matters'
	}
	options={{ symbolType: 'roman' }}
/>

Please note that:

-   symbols diatonic to the keys are rendered with color background
-   borrowed chords are rendered with a slightly darker background
-   unindentified chords are rendered without a background color

<TabbedChordMark
	src={'key C\nC/E Dm7/F Fm Gm Ab7'}
	options={{ symbolType: 'roman' }}
/>

If you are unsure of the key, just try a few candidates! You will be able to see immediately if the song has a lot of diatonic chords for this key.
And if it does, then the given key might be a good candidate.
