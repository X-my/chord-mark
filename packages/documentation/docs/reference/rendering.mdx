# Rendering options

`ChordMark` fully acknowledges the fact that when it comes to rendering a chord chart, there is no one size fits all and people's preferences might vary greatly.
The same people might also have different opinions depending on any given song!

Let's have a look at some possibilities.

Those options are not written in the file itself, but are rendering options of the `ChordMark` software.
They should be proposed by any chord chart editor compatible with `ChordMark`, such as `Chord Charts Studio`.

## Choosing what to render



## (Not) aligning chords and lyrics

Aligning chords with lyrics is the usual way of rendering chord charts.
But it's not the only one!
Thanks to `ChordMark` automatic alignment of bars between lines, one might find it clearer to actually NOT align the chords symbols with the lyrics.
This is especially true for jazz songs with a lot of chords and where the lyric placement is not always a reliable indicator for the chords changes.

Compare:

<RenderedChordMark title={'Chords aligned with lyrics'} src={data.alignChordsWithLyrics} />

With:

<RenderedChordMark title={'Bars aligned'} src={data.alignChordsWithLyrics} options={{ alignChordsWithLyrics: false}}/>

Or even: 

<RenderedChordMark title={'Bars not aligned'} src={data.alignChordsWithLyrics} options={{ alignChordsWithLyrics: false, alignBars: false}}/>

There is no right or wrong, it really depends on how well you know the melody, how complex are the chords changes, and what do you prefer to focus on.
One way might also print better than the other.
