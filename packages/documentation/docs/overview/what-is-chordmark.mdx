# What is ChordMark?

The purpose of <CM/> is to provide the easiest possible way to write accurate chord charts - eg. text-based song transcriptions with lyrics and chords - usable by all musicians, whether they sing or not, whether they already know the song or not, and whether the song harmony is complex or simple.

<CM/> is both:

- a grammar to write chords charts in a fast, efficient and accurate way, not only encoding lyrics and chords, but also rhythm information.
- an Open Source Javascript module, `chord-mark`, that can be used to process ChordMark files and format them with a high degree of customization.

<CM/> is supported by <CCS/>, a free, web-based, <CM/> native editor, that showcases all the possibilities of the format.

<CM/> has some unique features that makes it stand out from other formats:

-   it focuses on writability, allowing writing chord charts faster than ever
-   it offers a higher precision in the song transcription, thanks to its ability to encode rhythm information
-   it allows customising the rendering for each band member (and not only the one that sings)
