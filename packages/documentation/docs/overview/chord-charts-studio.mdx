# Chord Charts Studio

`Chord Charts Studio` is the official editor of `ChordMark`; it is freely available [online](http://chords-chart-studio.netlify.app).

It is currently the only editor that allows creating and formatting songs in the `ChordMark` format.
Since `ChordMark` is an Open Source project, more software might start implementing `ChordMark` in the future.
