# The ChordMark story

## Why a new format?

Like many things in this world, <CM/> was born out of frustration, and my frustration was oriented towards existing chord charts formats.

Chord charts are all around the web, and you might find them written as:

```
  C                 Am
I heard there was a secret chord
```

Or sometimes as:

```
I [C]heard there was a [Am]secret chord
```

Most of the time, they work fine. But they also fail very often. For example:

-   They are **mostly useless if you don't know the song beforehand**. And I get often asked to play songs I don't know by other people.
-   They get **very confusing when the song contain many chord changes**. Sometimes it becomes very hard to know how long a given chord should be played or when the change should happen. Not to mention if the time signature changes.
-   They are really **tailored to the singer musician**: if all you care about is the song structure or the chord grid, as a bass player or drummer for example, you will have a hard time getting that information in an accurate way from those chord charts.
-   Transposing them doesn't always work, because most software/website **fails to recognize complex chords symbols**. You end up with a chord chart mixing tonalities that you need to fix manually.

Sounds familiar? And that's only from a player point of view. From a transcriber point of view, my frustration with chord charts was even bigger:

-   they are **painful to write**, at least on a computer. You either need to enter spaces in order to position the chord on top of the lyrics, or put them between square brackets (eg, `[A7]`) in the middle of the lyrics line.
-   even if the chords are identical for each verse/chorus, you need to **repeat that painful process** of positioning/inserting the chords every time.
-   whenever you correct/change something, you are at risk of **breaking the chords/lyrics alignment**
-   they do not easily allow to **encode rhythm information**, unless you manually type the bar separators `|` and manually space the chords. Which makes the writing process even more painful.

For all those reasons, I would always cringe whenever I needed to write a song transcription. 
I came up with my own way of writing them - that I used to compile in a Word document - manually aligning chords and bar across lines in order to encode the rhythm structure of the songs.
While solving the issue about rhythm, it only made the writing process worse, while not allowing for easy key transposition.

## Enters ChordMark

I slowly came up with the idea of a new chord charts format that would solve the issues mentioned above.

The first step was to design a new syntax, with the purpose of encoding the maximum of information in the shortest possible way, so complex song transcriptions could be quickly written with a minimum of efforts.
The present documentation describes in detail this new syntax.

The next step was to build an interpreter that would transform the input syntax into nicely formatted chord charts to be printed or displayed on screen.
That is the purpose of `chord-mark`, a Javascript/NodeJs module. 
This module is open source and can be freely integrated by any tool or website that would be interested in <CM />.

The last missing piece was to build an editor that would natively support <CM /> and leverage all the format possibilities, so people would be able to try it out and, hopefully, adopt it: <CCS /> was born.

## ChordMark advantages

Chord charts written in <CM /> present the following advantages:

-   They are quick and easy to write. No need to space anything manually, to enclose chords in brackets or to mix them with lyrics.
-   Whenever possible, they also avoid you to repeat what you've already written once, making the transcription process quicker and more enjoyable.
-   They have native support for rhythm information, eg. how long a given chord should be played. That way, you can play a song even if you don't know it, and there is no ambiguity in the duration of each chord.
-   Having the rhythm information encoded also allows you to display only the chord grid or the song structure, which is great for other band members.
-   They recognize all possible chords symbols (or almost), even the most complex ones. So transposing always work.

## Development history

I've been playing with the idea of <CM /> in my mind for years: looking into my archive, I found some design documents from as far back as February 2015!

It took me 4 more years to actually start the development at the beginning of 2019. 
The first stable version of <CM/>, along with <CCS /> and <CS />, was released in June 2019.
I didn't do anything to promote it though, as I felt it was not ready for public release:
some basic functionalities - such as aligning the chords over the lyrics, or import/export features - were still lacking, not to mention user documentation which remained non-existent for a very long time.

Nevertheless, I've been using the 2019 version of <CM/> during two years for all my personal transcription work. 
I have been so happy with it that I've finally decided to resume the development during the summer of 2021:
I started implementing the features I had missed during my 2 years of "beta-testing", and they turned out so great - at least in my opinion! - that I feel the project is now mature enough to go public.
I hope more people will find it interesting!

## Previous work

Nothing is ever totally new, and <CM/> takes inspiration from some previous work (non-exhaustive list):

-   [ChordPro](https://www.chordpro.org/): the de-facto standard for chord charts interoperability. It has a great [community](https://groups.io/g/ChordPro/topics) and an extensive documentation. 
-   [TabDown](https://github.com/ultimate-guitar/Tabdown): the format used by the Ultimate Guitar website.
-   [Markato](https://markato.studio/): share the "chord position marker" concept with <CM />!
-   [LCR](https://lcr4songs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): although 2 years younger than <CM />, LCR also encodes rhythm information in chord charts and has a nice documentation on [music notation formats](https://lcr4songs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lcr/time-in-music-notation/).
-   [Playtab](https://www.vromans.org/johan/software/sw_playtab.html): by the author of the current ChordPro reference implementation.
-   [Rise up and sing](https://www.riseupandsing.org/songbooks/rise-up-singing/content/song-layout): an innovative way of writing chord charts.
